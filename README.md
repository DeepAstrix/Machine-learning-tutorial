## **Getting Started**

### **1. Clone or Download the Repository**

To begin, download the repository from GitHub. You can either:  
- **Clone the repository** using Git:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
  cd your-repo-name
  ```
- **Download the ZIP file**:
  - Go to the repository page on GitHub.
  - Click the green **Code** button.
  - Select **Download ZIP**.
  - Extract the ZIP file to your desired location.

---

### **2. Set Up the Environment**

Ensure you have Python installed on your system (preferably version 3.7 or higher).

#### **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

## **Requirements**

Install the following essential libraries using pip:
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas

### **3. Run the Code**

After setting up the environment, run the provided Python script to train the models and generate results.

1. Navigate to the project directory if not already there:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

### **4. Reproduce Results**

- The script will train models with different regularization methods (`Baseline`, `L2 Regularization`, and `Dropout`) and display validation loss and accuracy results for comparison.
- Graphs such as *Validation Loss Comparison*, *Training vs. Validation Accuracy* and *Distribution of Weights* will come out as results.
